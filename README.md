Spice up your git contribution heatmap. Run the `setup` script from inside your
repo of choice, and it will install a hook in cron.daily to push 0-10 empty
commits each weekday. Enjoy.

Note: This is meant in part to show some pitfalls of judging productivity or
impact by commit frequency. It is meant in other part as fun.
